# Summer Project
## Intro to Graphics and Shaders Recruitment Task

Making the vector.h and vector.cpp files.

## Vector.h file

It defines a Class Vector.
The class Vector contains three float attributes, which are the coordinates of the vector in 3D plane.

### Vector3()
This function seeks input for the coordinates of a vector
and initialises using Vector3(x,y,z) function.

### Printvector()
It prints the vector in the form : (a,b,c)

### AddVector(A) and SubtractVector(A)
These functions add and subtract a vector to a given vector
and prints the resultant vector.

### Magnitude
It returns the value (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^(1/2)

## Vector.cpp functions

### Dot(A,B)
It prints the value of dot product of vector A with vector B.

### Cross(A,B)
It prints the magnitude of the cross product vector C, where C=AxB (vector multiplication).
